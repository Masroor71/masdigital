									<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
										<p>Coastal Action, a non-profit organization, is currently facing the problem of housing for its employees</p>
										<p>in the region of Mahone Bay and nearby areas, which includes Chester, Bridgewater, and Lunenburg. As many UNESCO heritage areas exist, securing permission to build new homes is extremely difficult.&nbsp;</p>
										<p>In certain months, the high tourist influx and movie production in the area drive up rentals and difficulty securing new employees' homes. Also, as the community is highly close-knit, landlords prefer leasing the property to someone within their close contact.&nbsp;</p>
										<h2>Methodology:&nbsp;</h2>
										<p>We have followed four steps in the Design Thinking Process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype,</p>
										<p>and Test. We have done the following for each stage of the design thinking process:</p>
										<ol>
										<li><strong>Empathize:</strong> We have conducted interviews with Coastal Action employees and Landlords in Mahone Bay. We seek to understand the problem statement from both users in a non-judgemental manner.</li>
										<li><strong>Define:</strong> We defined the problem statement, identified the challenges, and tried to understand the decision-making processes of both users. Identifying the pain points helped us move to the next steps.</li>
										<li><strong>Ideate:</strong> As we move ahead, we share our ideas with Coastal Action employees, professors, landlords, and other batchmates. We brainstormed all possible ideas that address the problem from a multidimensional perspective. Lastly, we prioritized our ideas to create a working prototype.</li>
										<li><strong>Prototype:</strong> We created small mock-ups and tried to validate them with Ms. M and Ms. K, two senior staff at Coastal Action. We created MVP with a few features that would address the problem.</li>
										<li><strong>Test: </strong>We tested our prototype with our batch mates and Coastal Action employees to prioritize its unique value proposition. Moreover, the feedback and the criticism helped us understand the impediments quickly and iterate the solution soon. We tried to improve the MVP created based on the feedback we received.</li>
										</ol>
										

										<br>
										<h2>Proposed Solution:&nbsp;</h2>
										<p>Through this project, we aim to identify and propose a potential technological solution that aims at addressing the issue of housing and helping employees get access to verified and legitimate listings for short-term or long-term rental purposes in a specific region and get a reference from other employees in the organization for the shortlisted listing.</p>
										<p>And from the landlord's perspective, creating an easy-to-use platform to publish a listing and not just rely on word of mouth. Additionally, creating an additional income stream and finding legitimate tenants (employees of Coastal Action) on the platform.</p>

										<li>No trustworthy online platforms and a lot of fake listings on Facebook marketplace and Kijiji often seen</li>
										<li>Lease agreement often weekly that leads to the stress of getting notice to leave the accommodation anytime</li>
										<li>Staff from the movie/entertainment industry acquire most of the housing paying for rent at a much higher price and going for long-term lease agreement</li>
										<li>Not any other streams of income apart from government funds and the majority of funds goes towards salary and site projects</li>

										<h3>Challenges and Problems Identified in consideration of Prototype</h3>
										<table>
										<tbody>
										<tr>
										<td>
										<p>Building the Technological Platform and Infrastructure Needs</p>
										</td>
										<td>
										<p>The primary issue we might face is the design and development of the software or platform. Another constraint includes hiring highly skilled professionals capable of building the platform and ensuring that Coastal Action can adapt to the newly designed software and that the software can integrate easily within their system. Lastly, figuring out the resources and infrastructure requirements for building the platform, such as servers, hosting, programming language, etc.</p>
										</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>
										<p>Platform Maintenance</p>
										</td>
										<td>
										<p>There will be a constant need for expertise to maintain and update the technological platform. This task requires at least one professional who can be available at all times to service and address any issues that may arise and for upkeep. This would be a fixed expense that Coastal Action would have to bear.</p>
										</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>
										<p>Platform Adoption and Gaining Trust from Users</p>
										</td>
										<td>
										<p>Given the lack of awareness about platforms like &lsquo;Coastal Roof,&rsquo; it might initially prove to be a challenging task to familiarize the new users, i.e., the landlords, with the platform and get them acquainted with it. Advertising the platform through Coastal Action&rsquo;s website and related sources would help boost trust and engagement. Though initially, it may be difficult, the platform would soon gain traction as the users grow and the word spreads through the employees and landlords in the area.</p>
										</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>
										<p>Designing the User Interface</p>
										</td>
										<td>
										<p>Making the User Interface easy is the primary goal while providing the most details and options about the listings to ensure all users, landlords, and employees feel comfortable using the platform. Though a minor hurdle, it can be easily overcome with the help of the right software design.</p>
										</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>
										<p>Marketing</p>
										</td>
										<td>
										<p>Performing A/B testing to identify the target audience we want to advertise the platform. Also, identifying and selecting the proper social media channels for better engagement. Lastly, finding the right spot to position the product in the market will be a hard to crack.</p>
										</td>
										</tr>
